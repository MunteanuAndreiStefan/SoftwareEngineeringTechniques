# Real time fake news detection
Project for advanced software engineering techniques subject on Distribuited System master

Functional requirements:
  - Information will be collected from Twitter (posts, user information (number of posts, folowers, account creation date, etc.))
  - The application will run for chrome and firefox
  - User profiles will be built (characterized by details about the user, user activity, reactions of other users to what he does on the network, etc.)
  - A metric will be proposed to calculate the credibility of a post
  - A metric will be proposed for credibility of a user
  - A metainformation should be taken into consideration
  - Methods will be proposed to detect "fake" users and "fake" news
  - We could have a list of fake users centralized in order to get a better response, after the front-end is putting the user in a category
  - Resources we will be centralized in order to get faster responses for already processed news
  - Resources will be used outside the Twitter network to validate the information (Google, blogs, newspapers, etc.)
  - Fronted will be able to show extra information about metrics
  - Fronted will be able to edit the stric level of the marking
  - Fronted will show analized resources
  - All users will be unique

Actor will be:
  - Any user that will have the plugin installed

Use cases:
  - User will be able to install the plugin from a store
  - User will be able to disable / enable the application.
  - User will be able to set the maximum/minimum level of marking a news as fake
  - User will be able to see results from a news
  - User will be able to see what resources we found
