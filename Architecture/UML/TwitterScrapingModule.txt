Crisnuta Gabriel - I will be in charge of Twitter Scraping Module. This module consists of a python script which will run permanently, crawling Twitter posts (probably tweets containing a specifig tag or tweets returned after searching for a keyword),getting info about them (tweets + user accounts) calling functions from Tweepy (Python wraper for Twitter API) and store them into a DB (maybe Redis).
